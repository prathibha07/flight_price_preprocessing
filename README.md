# flight_price_preprocessing

Contains scripts and instructions for preprocessing flight price data. 
Goal: Preprocessing pipeline with data cleaning and prep for analysis

# Overview
The flight price preprocessing pipeline is designed to handle raw flight price data, clean it, and transform it into a format suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

# Features
1. Data cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
2. Feature engineering: Creating new features and encoding categorical variables.
3. Data normalization: Scaling numerical features for better performance in machine learning models.
